# general instructions

instructions.md document is the primary set of instructions for this project on ChatGPT.

# knowledge base and assets

## master

llm-master.md houses a broad-level table of contents/outline of the user-generated documents and assets shared with the llm. this is the start of this collection of documents.

## resources, docs, and reference material

this document serves as a database of information for the llm to draw from to improve answers, make them more specific to the user requests, and more effectively assist the user in their needs.
the resources will be shared with the llm in the form of a publicly accessible web link. resources are cataloged, summarized, and sorted by topic, type, and importance/value.

## working notes

working-notes.md is a real-time notes file for documenting ideas, workflow, processes, etc. during the creation of a given work/experiment and broadly for notes related to the entire project.
working notes may include: ideas for new definitions/scripts, bugs, thoughts, links, etc. this is a "brain dump" document and is prone to changing frequently.

## outputs

outputs.md holds code, notes, bugs, fixes, and more regarding output work product created in conjuction with llm.
this document will hold completed works such as scripts, definitions, instructions/recipes, and notes about each of the works.
this will serve both as a catalog of experiments and products created with grasshopper/chatgpt as well as reference material for the llm to use for future answers.

## additional info

all documents, work product, research, files, assets, etc. are in a continous state of progress. therefore, none of these are final and are subject to change. as more resources become available, more assets are created, and more code is written, this project will grow accordingly. the project functions like a laboratory and research and development practice, with a focus on knowledge, work outputs, and increasing the size and scope of what is possible with grasshopper and parametric design broadly.
