cell creator    , generates a variety of grids based on user selection and allows for control over pattern; # of cells in x and y; cell size; and origin, https://github.com/felipeharker/harkitecture-lab/raw/main/parametric-design/scripts/cell%20creator.py    , none, none , system of standardizing grids and grid choices. currently feels arbitrary                                                                                                                                                                          , none

cell patternizer, creates a variety of unique patterns based on grid cell inputs and other user conditions, https://github.com/felipeharker/harkitecture-lab/raw/main/parametric-design/scripts/cell%20patternizer.py, none, none , a stronger relationship between the cell creator and the patternizer. currently some cells break the patternizer and some patterns are weak. would like a relationship and some standardization of the work to make things easier to use and modify, none

image sampler, creates a variable scale geometric array/grid based on the light and dark tonal values of a user defined image, https://github.com/felipeharker/harkitecture-lab/blob/main/parametric-design/scripts/image%20sampler.py, none, none, none
