## resources, docs, and reference materials

### document name

llm-master.md

### description

houses all the information about the project's instructions, resources, knowledge base, notes, and outputs.
this document serves largely as a table of contents and some material found here will be repeated in other documents.

### document name

resources-index.csv

### description

houses documents (pdf, py, txt, md, etc.) names, locations, and descriptions/notes for each document. pertinent to research and information the llm should use as reference material. while the resources index houses many resources, some may not always be relevant to the llm. the database is inclusive and will expand as more resources, docs, etc. are found, created, and cataloged.

### document name

web-resource-index.csv

### web-resources-index.csv

houses names, links/urls, and descriptions for pertinent web-based research, tutorials, forum threads, and other information the llm should use as reference. this document will house a lot of resources which may not always be relevant. the database is inclusive and will expand as more resources, docs, etc. are found and cataloged.

## working notes

https://github.com/felipeharker/harkitecture-lab/raw/main/artificial-intelligence/working-notes.md
is a real-time notes file for documenting ideas, workflow, processes, etc. during the creation of a given work/experiment and broadly for notes related to the entire project.

https://github.com/felipeharker/harkitecture-lab/blob/main/artificial-intelligence/prompts-notebook.md
is a document which holds notes about prompt-crafting and communicating with llm.
this document is primarily for personal use and may not be an effective resource for the agent, nonetheless important to workflow and documentation.

## outputs

https://github.com/felipeharker/harkitecture-lab/raw/main/artificial-intelligence/outputs.csv
holds code, notes, bugs, fixes, and more regarding output work product created in conjuction with llm.

# general instructions

instructions.md document is the primary set of instructions for this project on chatgpt.

## behavioral instructions

no emojis, no slang, no typos

professional programmer, output strong, maintainable code when prompted

solutions-oriented, logical, critical thinking

## scope of work

the model's primary scope of work will be in parametric and computational design theory, practice, research, and troubleshooting

the model should reference mcneel's documentation related to rhino, grasshopper, etc. as well as documentation related to python and other relevant programming languages

model should reference publicly accessible, crowd-sourced information sources such as forums, wikis, code repositories, etc.

model should reference high quality, factual information

## outputs

code should be legible, clean, and commented for ease of use and practicality

# knowledge base and assets

## master

llm-master.md houses a broad-level table of contents/outline of the user-generated documents and assets shared with the llm. this is the start of this collection of documents.

## resources, docs, and reference material

resource-index.csv document serves as a database of information for the llm to draw from to improve answers, make them more specific to the user requests, and more effectively assist the user in their needs.
the resources will be shared with the llm in the form of a publicly accessible web link. resources are cataloged, summarized, and sorted by topic, type, and importance/value.

## working notes

working-notes.md is a real-time notes file for documenting ideas, workflow, processes, etc. during the creation of a given work/experiment and broadly for notes related to the entire project.
working notes may include: ideas for new definitions/scripts, bugs, thoughts, links, etc. this is a "brain dump" document and is prone to changing frequently.

## outputs

outputs.csv holds code, notes, bugs, fixes, and more regarding output work product created in conjuction with llm.
this document will hold completed works such as scripts, definitions, instructions/recipes, and notes about each of the works.
this will serve both as a catalog of experiments and products created with grasshopper/chatgpt as well as reference material for the llm to use for future answers.

## additional info

all documents, work product, research, files, assets, etc. are in a continous state of progress. therefore, none of these are final and are subject to change. as more resources become available, more assets are created, and more code is written, this project will grow accordingly. the project functions like a laboratory and research and development practice, with a focus on knowledge, work outputs, and increasing the size and scope of what is possible with grasshopper and parametric design broadly.
